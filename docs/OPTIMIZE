* Use 32-bit or 64-bit intergers instead of 8-bit integers when predicting, 
  dequantizing and transforming if SIMD instructions are unavailable.
* Replace function clamp() with some inlined assembly function.
* Optimize IWHT and IDCT if there is no coefficient or only one
  coefficient.
* Store the transformed residuals inside a macroblock pixel by pixel
  instead of subblock by subblock in raster scan order. By storing
  residuals in this order it would be easier to sum the predicted pixels
  and the residuals.
* Store 4x4 predict subblocks in the intermediate frame instead of a two
  dimensional array allocated on stack.
* Spawn different threads to decode metadata, decode residuals and apply
  loop filters.
